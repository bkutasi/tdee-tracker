## Agent Guidelines
- **Precision**: Fix floating-point issues (`0.0000002`) wherever found.
- **Verification**: Always verify changes with small test scripts or by modifying `tests/`.
- **Style**: Maintain the vanilla JS structure. Do not introduce build tools (Webpack/Vite) unless explicitly requested.
- **Testing**: Always test changes with the test suite and small test scripts.
- **Commit Messages**: Use conventional commit messages. And commit after you tested successfully.
- **Gemini.md**: Update this file after every change, or important insights.
